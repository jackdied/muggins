Implements the "Muggins" rules of Dominoes.

Originally written as a one-off in 2009 for a blog post (see original_blog.txt).
Ressurected here because the original linked code is gone and someone requested a copy.

The code was dashed off in a few hours and has surprising results - namely one strategy isn't much better than another. As the original blog post points out this is a very surprising result. I'll offer an additional explanation for the result not mentioned in 2009 -- namely there is a bug in my code. Good luck!
